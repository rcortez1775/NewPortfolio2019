With keepPUP, users can store when they walked or fed their pet and share that information with other users. Building the app was a lot of fun as it allowed me to really show my personality with design and UI.</p>

The idea came from the many hurdles I faced when learning to program. Documentation can be advanced to parse through for beginners so we set out to create a more simple and intuitive way to solve that problem.</p>
